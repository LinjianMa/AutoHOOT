This folder includes the graph data structures of einsum (einsum graph), and the transfer between
einsum expressions and the einsum graph.

1. *union_find*: The union find data structure.

2. *graph_structure*: Contains the data structures used to represent the einsum graph.

3. *graph_generator*: Contains functions to generate einsum graphs from einsum expressions.

4. *expr_generator*: Contains functions to generate einsum expressions from einsum graphs.
