    Parameters
    ----------
    tensors: array of tensors representing the MPS
    right: direction of the transformation. If true,
        for the output mps, the diagram for its inner product will be:

                 o-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<         o-
        if False, the diagram of its inner product will be:

                 >->->->->->->->-o          -o
                 | | | | | | | | |   =     | | (inner product of o)
                 >->->->->->->->-o          -o

        here > or < denotes a tensor that is left / right orthogonal.
